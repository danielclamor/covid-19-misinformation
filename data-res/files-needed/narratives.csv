It is just COVID,"The first narrative emerges from the tweets that implies the inferiority of the COVID-19 among other illnesses. These tweets usually contain the words ``less’’ and ``more’’. The tweet ``I just don’t understand why people are more afraid of the nCOV than measles which has a higher mortality rate’’ is one of the tweets that can be interpreted that we should not be afraid of the new strain of coronavirus since it is less dangerous. Similar tweets compare COVID-19 and other specific viral infections like HIV and common flu. Using the term ``lang'' [just/simply/only] is also common in tweets included in this narrative. The term is usually found in phrases like ``ncov ka lang'' [you are just nCoV] or ``covid lang yan'' [it is just COVID]. People tend to justify a future plan or an action done amidst the pandemic (``HAHAHHA ARAT COVID LANG YAN GALA TAYO'' [it is just COVID let us hang out]). Tweets with satirical content are also prevalent with 76 occurrences in the data set. Satirical tweets can be hard to detect without knowing their context. Tweets like ``mas marami pa ang infected ng tiktok virus kesa covid jusko mama’’ [more are infected by the tiktok virus than COVID oh my God mama] could be interpreted in different ways such as: it could imply that the new strain of coronavirus should not be a concern since there are more people using the TikTok app and ``infected’’ by it than the number of people in the Philippines infected by COVID-19, or it could suggest that a new virus named ``Tiktok’’ does exist. Some tweets may suggest, as a joke, a cure for COVID-19; like ``Puno na nang alcohol katawan ko malamang neto covid free nako'' [my body is full of alcohol I'm probably COVID free]. There are also tweets that contain puns and word plays. One example is a portmanteau of Kobe Bryant and COVID-19, COVID Bryant. Other tweets show a different meaning to the terms ``nCoV'' and ``COVID''. For instance, ``NCoV- NEED CASH ON VALENTINES''. The tweets covering this narrative show that Filipinos find hope in a disaster by making big problems seem small. Downplaying the COVID-19 by comparing it against other fatal virus may be from the fact that COVID-19 was new in the country at the time of posting such tweets that is why people had the impression on COVID-19 being a weaker virus. Adding humor to tweets about COVID-19 is another way of downplaying the virus and its effects that may demonstrate a less cautious way to live through the pandemic."
What now?,"A second narrative emerges from tweets that express negative sentiments towards the situation. The tweets' subjects in this cluster of themes revolve around government's response (and lack of response). The phrase ``vote wisely'', with 9 occurrences, can also be seen in the tweets, sometimes paired with ``next election'', as a reminder for the people. There are tweets that express disappointment towards the mentioned name of official, either from a local or a national government post. A total of 9 tweets were seen mentioning 'Mayor Joy', mayor of Quezon City, Philippines. The phrase was seen together with words ``anuna'' or ``ano na'' [what now]. People also express their disappointment by not voting for the politician next election. There are also tweets, a total of 32, that mention the name and nickname of President Rodrigo ``Digong'' Duterte. Some tweets contain a mockery of his own words, way of speaking, and strange solutions; for example, ``Akala ko iihian na naman niya eh'' [i thought he will pee on it again] wherein a solution Pres. Duterte proposed, last 13\textsuperscript{th} of January 2020, to pee on the Taal volcano to stop the eruption was also suggested by a Twitter user to kill the coronavirus; and the term ``veerus'' which how he pronounced the word ``virus'' in his press conference last 3\textsuperscript{rd} of February 2020. The tweet ``State of calamity ba dahil ba sa coronavirus o sa Duterte Veerus!?! I really wanna know...'' [state of calamity because of the coronavirus or the Duterte Veerus!?! I really wanna know...] implies that there is a possibility that Duterte was the one causing the big problem of the country. Some people are expressing their disapproval of not imposing a travel ban immediately -- ``4th is the very best, if this digong ordered at once the blocking of all chinese nationals from entering our ports and airports, there is no way for ncov to enter our country.'' In the data set, it is common to see tweets that contain government's official announcements, protocols, and guidelines that comes with personal comments and opinions. Data shows that people are blaming the government for the COVID-19 outbreak in the Philippines."
The virus,"The third narrative is clustered from tweets that tell stories or share knowledge about the COVID-19. In 7 tweets, it is implied that the COVID-19 was created as a ``biochemical weapon''. For example, ``Lemme make my own assumptions regarding CoVId reaching S.Korea. Not sure if everyone knows that this started as a Biochemical Weapon being made by the Chinese people \& was spread for reasons we are not sure how. Also its meant to be used to attack somewhere.. And how this spread.'' There are also tweets that explains the weaknesses of the virus and how we can avoid contracting it. Some would say that heat can kill the virus (``Good amount of people wearing masks in Manila. Don’t they know heat kills coronavirus?). Drinking liquor, according to them, could kill the virus (``uminom ka lang..mabisang panlaban yan sa covid'' [just drink..effective against COVID]). Since rubbing alcohol is effective in surface sanitation and killing the virus, we could also drink it (``Tara inom ng alcohol iwas sa covid haha'' [let us drink alcohol to avoid COVID haha]). In addition to drinking liquor or rubbing alcohol, tweets about boosting and strengthening the immune system is recurring 33 times. It is said that adequate sleep, healthy diet, proper hygiene, and drinking vitamins are enough to survive from the virus or even prevent yourself from acquiring it (``I was told a ketogenic diet improves the immune system, thus a good incentive in fighting ncoV.''). And people who have weaker immune system is more vulnerable to the disease (``Yari ako Kay CoVid-19 .., Mahina Immune system ko Hays'' [i am doomed because of COVID-19.., my immune system is weak'']). In the data pool, conspiracy theories are common. False knowledge about the nature of the virus could have an effect on how people will approach the situation. Some tweets covered by this narrative can also be taken as a joke especially the ones about drinking rubbing alcohol to kill the virus inside our body. It could also be observed that people share tips and reminders in fighting COVID-19 out of concern for others."
